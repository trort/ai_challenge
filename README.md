2011 Fall Ai Challenge Code for trort

This program is written based on the C++ starter kit provided at https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/tree/epsilon/ants/dist/starter_bots/cpp

Most parts of my algorithm are implemented at functions in Bot.cc and State.cc. The files are the ones submitted 3 years ago, with all the codes for debugging left untouched.
